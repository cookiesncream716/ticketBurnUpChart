This is a plugin for [Tixit](https://tixit.me/) that will display a chart comparing the number of total tickets to the number of open tickets in a project. The start date is the date that the project was created and the end date is the current date. Depending on how much time there is between the start date and end date, the chart will dispaly daily, weekly, biweekly, or monthly data.

There are no special configuration options for this plugin. To use it, simply create a new layout and add it as a component or add it to an existing layout.
